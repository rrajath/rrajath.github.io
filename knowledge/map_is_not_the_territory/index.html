<h2 id="the-map-is-not-the-territory">The Map is not the Territory</h2>
<p>In other words, the description of the thing is not the thing itself.</p>
<p>A map of a territory is a reduction. It&rsquo;s imperfect and it misses a lot of detail, but only captures the relevant details. If the map has to be the perfect depiction of a territory, it would be as big as the territory, at which point it would be pointless to have a map. Maps are useful to represent only a subset of information that is relevant about the territory. For example, the map of a subway which doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the distance between various stops or what you can find along the way, but just the names of stops - which is exactly what is needed for a traveler using a subway.</p>
<p>The truth is, the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction. When we read the news, we&rsquo;re consuming abstractions created by other people. The authors consume vast amounts of information on a subject and abstract them out into a book, which we then read and try to understand the subject. But something is always lost in the process. And, because we often consume these abstractions as gospel, without having done the hard mental work ourselves, it&rsquo;s tricky to see when the map no longer agrees with the territory. We inadvertently forget that the map is not reality.</p>
<p>We need maps, and models as guides. But frequently, we don&rsquo;t remember that our maps and models are abstractions and thus we fail to understand their limits. We forget there is a territory that exists separately from the map. This territory contains details the map doesn&rsquo;t describe. We run into problems when our knowledge becomes of the map, rather than the actual underlying territory it describes.</p>
<p>When we mistake the map for reality, we start to think we have all the answers. We create static rules or policies that deal with the map but forget that we exist in a constantly changing world. We can&rsquo;t use maps as static references, when the world we&rsquo;re living is dynamic. When the world around us changes, we have to update our maps.</p>
<p><strong>Tragedy of the Commons</strong></p>
<p>It is a concept where people take advantage of and overuse what&rsquo;s common to everyone with the assumption that their singular overuse wouldn&rsquo;t affect the whole.</p>
<p>Imagine a pasture of land in a village where all the herders can let their animals graze. If everybody follows this, it&rsquo;ll work out fine. But once in a while, one of them will think that adding another animal wouldn&rsquo;t make much of a difference. There are 2 points to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding another animal will add the same value as existing animals. So it will increase the positive by 1.</li>
<li>Letting it graze on the pasture would increase the negative by only a fraction of 1 because it&rsquo;s using the common land.</li>
</ol>
<p>So the benefits outweigh the negatives and the herder adds another animal, and then another and then another. Soon, every single herder will do the same and that leads to tragedy of the commons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes these models so dangerous, is that the constraints that are assumed to be fixed for the purposes of the analysis are taken on faith as being fixed in the empirical setting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a double problem. First, having a general map, we may think that if the territory matches the map in couple of respects then it matches the map in all respects. Second, we may think adherence to the map is more important than taking in new information of the territory.</p>
<p>In order to use a map or a model as accurately as possible, we have to take the following 3 considerations into account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reality is the ultimate update</li>
<li>Consider the cartographer</li>
<li>Maps can influence territories</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reality is the ultimate update</strong>
We have to remember that a map captures a territory at a moment in time. Just because it might have done a good at depicting what was, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it correctly depicts what there is now, or what will be in the future. The faster the rate of change of a territory, the harder it is for the map to keep it up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the cartographer</strong>
The one making the map will have a certain set of viewpoints, thoughts and opinions on the territory and they get translated into a map. It is not helpful to just look at the map, but one must also consider where the cartographer was coming from while making this map</p>
<p><strong>Maps can influence territories</strong>
Sometimes you already have a map and you try to apply it to a territory. It may not always work out, and can have negative consequences.</p>
<h3 id="my-thoughts-interpretations">My thoughts/interpretations</h3>
<p>Apart from the examples given in the book - map of a place, becoming a parent, and stereotypes, I consider the following as maps and it has enhanced my understanding of the concept:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Education system</strong>: decades ago the education system that we see today was created based on the job landscape that existed during that time. Then, the reality updated, but the maps didn&rsquo;t. Job landscape changed a lot requiring not only new skills, but also new ways of learning and adapting to changing situations. And, the education system became outdated; they continued with the same system without updating it. Only now, after 2015 or so, the education system changed to be more focused on application of what students learn than memorizing stuff.</li>
</ol>
