			<p>To set the context, Weekly Noise series is where I talk about what I accomplished during the week (like working on my personal projects among other things) and also set the goals for next week. So this will be a weekly iteration of my progress in the projects I work on.</p>
<p>So to start off with the Weekly Noise series, I would share an update on what happened in the last one month. Here&rsquo;s my story on hopping between different blogging platforms in the quest to find the right one (for me).</p>
<p>The story so far:</p>
<p>I wanted to have a very simple, minimalistic, no fluff kind of a blog to share my thoughts. Though I&rsquo;m far from being a designer, a good theme is a must and I don&rsquo;t stop unless I find a good one. Given that I&rsquo;m a little too lazy, I wanted something of very minimal effort; as little as writing a blog post in a text file and posting it on the web. So I tried the following:</p>
<h3 id="wordpresshttpwwwwordpresscom"><a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a></h3>
<p>Nope. Not my cup of tea. I started off with Wordpress and somehow I didn&rsquo;t really like the themes there. Moreover, it was a little too much for my needs. One of the main reasons for not choosing Wordpress is that there&rsquo;s no freedom when it comes to editing the existing theme and I wasn&rsquo;t really happy with that. It has an admin panel that&rsquo;s not very helpful in terms of version control.</p>
<h3 id="scriptogramhttpwwwscriptogram"><a href="http://www.scriptogr.am">Scriptogr.am</a></h3>
<p>I really liked this blogging for it offered Markdown editing and Dropbox sync which makes it a good choice for quick blogging. But the theme editor is not all that great and also, I didn&rsquo;t see much support for Scriptogr.am. They&rsquo;re not very active on Twitter, nor have they updated their own official blog for more than a year. And the link to their support page hasn&rsquo;t been working for the past one month or so. It turned me off and I had to switch to something else. It&rsquo;s probably still in its nascent stage of development, but I don&rsquo;t see much happening at their end (at least that&rsquo;s what it looks like).</p>
<h3 id="ghosthttpghostorg"><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a></h3>
<p>When Ghost was launched to the public, no wonder there was so much buzz in the blogging and web hosting communities. It indeed lives up to its expectations and I believe it&rsquo;s a great blogging platform. It does what it says - nothing more, nothing less. But the catch is I need a VPS to host it for which I have to pay every month. And there&rsquo;s also the reliability and latency issues that come with every VPS. So I ditched Ghost in the hope of finding something that better suited my needs.</p>
<h3 id="along-came-github-pageshttppagesgithubcom">Along came <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></h3>
<p>I stumbled upon <a href="http://sirupsen.com/the-switch-to-github-pages/">this page</a> which hinted me to take a peek at GitHub pages and I was impressed. I checked out <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com">Jekyll</a> and it seemed perfect and exactly what I wanted. All I had to do was, fork the repo and push my posts to GitHub. As simple as that.</p>
<p>Posts can be created in markdown. A simple rake command generates the boilerplate stuff to get you started.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">rake post title<span style="color:#719e07">=</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;A new blog post&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above command is all that is needed to create a new post. It fills up the new file with headers which has some important information that looks something like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">---
layout: post  
title: &#34;Weekly Noise #1&#34;  
description: &#34;Moving to GitHub pages&#34;  
category: &#34;weekly-noise&#34;  
tags: [weekly, noise]
---
&lt;Write your blog post here&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Once you&rsquo;re done writing a post, you just have to add, commit and push</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">git add .
git commit
git push origin master
</code></pre></div><p>And Voila! You&rsquo;re done. :)</p>
<p>GitHub Pages is so simple and fast. It doesn&rsquo;t need a database, the so-called admin panel is just a YAML config file. And the best part is, the whole blog is in your control. <em>You</em> have the freedom to change anything and everything.</p>
<p>I spent the week customizing the blog and pushing my changes to the repo. There are still couple of changes that I should be doing. But most of the blog layout and plugins are in place. Here&rsquo;s the target for next week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the Navbar at the top of the blog.</li>
<li>Write a blog post about my theme setup.</li>
</ul>
