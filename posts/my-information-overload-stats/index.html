			<p>I’m no stranger to consuming information on my phone, computer, iPad, etc. I consume them in various forms - text (with newsletters, RSS feeds, read it later services), audio (with podcasts) and video (YouTube). I quit social media several years ago and I’ve always felt good that I don’t spend hours and hours scrolling through my feed on websites like Facebook, Instagram, etc. And my YouTube subscriptions are most educational anyway.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been feeling that even though the content I consume are all something constructive and something I can learn about, it’s been too much for me to handle. So, I’m making this post just to take a snapshot of what I call the Informational Overload Snapshot at this moment in time in order to understand how much of content I’m subscribed to, how much I’m actually reading/watching/listening to, how much value I’m getting out of all this.</p>
<p>So, here is my Information Overload Snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newsletters</strong>: I’m subscribed to about 20-25 newsletters and I have a total of 2000+ unread newsletters in my email. It doesn’t really tempt me to go and read it all. There’s no way I can do that anyway. It’s something I pick and choose whenever I want to read something - like <a href="https://hackernewsletter.com/">HackerNewsLetter</a>, <a href="https://bytes.dev/">Bytes</a>, <a href="https://fs.blog/newsletter/">Farnam Street</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Podcasts</strong>: subscribed to 33 in total. There are some I listen to as soon as an episode comes out. There are some that have so many episodes that I pick and choose what I want to listen to. There are some I hardly ever listen to, but still keep them around so that I get to it at some point, and I never listen to any of the episodes in them.</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feeds</strong>: Not a lot, about a dozen subscriptions. LessWrong is one of the big ones because of the high number of posts that get submitted there. What I end up doing is, every few days I go and mark all posts on LessWrong as ’read’. So, excluding LessWrong on average I’d have about 60-80 unread posts in my RSS feed. Every time I think of unsubscribing from this RSS feed, I find some post that I get a lot of value from when I skim through it and I just end up keeping it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://hq.getmatter.com/">Matter</a></strong>: This is a read-it-later app that I’ve been using for some time and whenever I come across long articles that are interesting, I put it in here for later. I don’t have a lot here, about 26 articles but they’re all long articles. Each of them take several minutes to read.</li>
<li><strong>Reddit</strong>: most of my subscriptions to subreddits are something that serve my curiosity. They all depend on my current interests. I’m not subscribed to fun subreddits like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/funny">/r/funny</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/Unexpected">/r/Unexpected</a>, etc. But rather to subreddits like <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ExplainLikeImFive">/r/ExplainLikeImFive</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/AskScience">/r/AskScience</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs">/r/emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fishshell">/r/fishshell</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards">/r/ErgoMechKeyboards</a>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Mastodon</strong>: mostly used for informational purposes. I’m part of an emacs instance, fosstodon and indieweb instances. No time-wasters, really. No &ldquo;fun&rdquo; instances.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube</strong>: I’m subscribed to about 20+ channels and about half of them post regular updates. And almost all of them are educational content or something that I’m interested in.</li>
<li><strong>Open tabs in my browsers</strong>: Yeah, I said browsers because I’m including what I use on my laptop, phone and iPad. My phone has about 50+ open tabs. My laptop has less than a dozen open tabs. My iPad has about the same number.</li>
<li><strong>HackerNews</strong>: I rarely use HackerNews since I’m subscribed to the newsletter. But every now and then I do go to Hackernews out of boredom.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be the first part of my exercise to start cutting down on stuff I consume. My future posts will (hopefully) capture some cutbacks, unsubscribes, deletions and letting go of things.</p>
