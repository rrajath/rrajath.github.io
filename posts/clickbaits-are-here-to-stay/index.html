				<p>More than a decade ago I came across BuzzFeed articles like &ldquo;10 things you didn&rsquo;t know about the Illuminati, number 7 will surprise you&rdquo; for the first time. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t even know they were called clickbait. This reminded me of the tabloids I saw near checkout lines in grocery stores. Every time I&rsquo;d see one of those magazines, I used to think, &ldquo;This is beyond ridiculous. Who reads this stuff?&rdquo;. In my mind, I used to categorize tabloids as the lowest form of &ldquo;news&rdquo; and just a desperate attempt to get peoples&rsquo; attention to buy those magazines, and in my opinion that&rsquo;s still the case.</p>
<p>But when I started seeing more and more clickbaits online, I started becoming infuriated because now they were everywhere. I was seeing the equivalent of tabloid headlines in most of the websites I used to visit and it felt like there was no escaping them. I initially thought only sites like BuzzFeed and similar ones would be so desperate for attention and clicks, and real news sites wouldn&rsquo;t need clickbaits.</p>
<p>I was wrong. I started seeing them even on websites like HackerNews or AndroidPolice. It was annoying me so much that I didn&rsquo;t click those links on purpose, even though I knew it had information that I was looking for. It was my way of &ldquo;vote with your clicks&rdquo;. And then, it was all over YouTube too. The channels I subscribe to - Red Delta Project, Veritasium, etc. that have nothing to do with gossip or sensational news, but instead make educational content were also filled with titles that were very clickbait-y.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like it, and I was hoping this was just a fad that would pass. I thought it would be one of those things where companies would jump on just to be part of whatever trend was going on and then drop it when it&rsquo;s no longer &ldquo;cool&rdquo;. But at the back of my mind, I was thinking that clickbaits are only growing because they work. People click such links and clicks is what a service primarily measures (among other things) the popularity of its article.</p>
<p>I recently saw a video on Veritasium titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2xHZPH5Sng">Clickbait Is Unreasonably Effective</a>. This hit home with me. If people tend to click on clickbait articles, then there <em>will</em> be more clickbait articles. This is one thing if a blog contains a bunch of such articles. But if a serivce like YouTube takes uploaded videos and ranks them, and happens to find clickbait-y videos perform better, it&rsquo;ll just rank those videos higher. And if I&rsquo;m a YouTube content creator, and I want to stay in the game, I&rsquo;d have to play the same game. As much as I hate clickbait, I&rsquo;d still have to add a clickbait title, a clickbait thumbnail and a clickbait caption in the thumbnail. And not to forget a corny facial expression on the thumbnail.</p>
<p>What I saw in the above video did put things into perspective as to why clickbait even exists and why everybody seems to be using it more and more. I still cringe when I see such titles. What scares me even more is, a lot of times any title I try to come up with for a blog post that I write, I start feeling like it&rsquo;s clickbait-y. I spend more time thinking about how to not make the title sound very clickbait-y. Or how to make the title sound as least clickbait-y as possible. Sometimes I fail. But I still try.</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say are two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether anybody likes it or not, I think clickbaits will continue ot exist and thrive as long as clicks (or click-through rate) is used as one of the dominant metrics. That&rsquo;s just the world we live in now.</li>
<li>I try my best to come up with titles that are not clickbait-sounding. I&rsquo;d rather want the reader to not be interested to read my blogpost after looking at the headline than cringe hard at the headline.</li>
</ol>
