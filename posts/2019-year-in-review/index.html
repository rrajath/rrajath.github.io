				<p>Another year done, and like always time flies by quicker and quicker every year. 2019 has been quite eventful in a few aspects and I took some time to reflect on how things went. This time I categorized my activities and personal growth into 3 sections - things I did more of, things I did less of, things I explored. Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
<h1 id="things-i-did-more-of">Things I did more of</h1>
<h2 id="running">Running</h2>
<p>I was faster (compared to last year) in almost all my races in 2019. I also participated in more races and set a few PRs.</p>
<h3 id="stats">Stats</h3>
<p>All in for Autism 10K - 53m 33s</p>
<p>Mother&rsquo;s Day Half - 1h 57m</p>
<p>The Big Run 5K (trail run) - 29m 1s</p>
<p>Evergreen Half - 1h 53m</p>
<p>Craft Classic Half - 1h 49m</p>
<p>Iron Horse Half - 1h 42m</p>
<p>Fly 5K - 25m 46s</p>
<p>Snohomish 10K - 51m 51s</p>
<p>Snohomish River Run Full - 3h 56m</p>
<p>I started off with the 10K in April with no training and I&rsquo;m happy to see that my time only improved from then on. There was a time when I was running half marathons every couple of weeks and it got a little exhausting. But it feels great to look back and see all the races I&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<h3 id="marathon">Marathon</h3>
<p>The full marathon gets a special mention because the training was fun and the race, even more so. In 2018, I did my first full marathon and the training was quite brutal - mostly because I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. And, I got first hand experience of what mile 18 feels like in a full marathon. But in 2019, I knew how the training would be, I knew how to prep and how to recover, when to push myself and when to take it easy. I used <a href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon">Hal Higdon&rsquo;s Intermediate 1 training plan</a> and made my own modifications to it. Overall, I improved and set a PR.</p>
<h2 id="traveling">Traveling</h2>
<p>I did some traveling in 2019 with a few road trips - one in Oregon, couple in Washington, and few hikes around Seattle. I also visited Los Angeles. The most amazing and memorable one was the 4-day Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu which was a birthday gift from my wife. Highly recommend going there and doing the 4-day hike, it&rsquo;s totally worth it. Also, a shout out to <a href="https://www.alpacaexpeditions.com">Alpaca Expeditions</a> for their awesome crew that helped us with the hike, food, camps, etc.</p>
<h1 id="things-i-did-less-of">Things I did less of</h1>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>I fell off on the reading habit and ended up reading only about 14 books (compared to 24 in 2018). This is something I want to get back into.</p>
<h2 id="working-out">Working out</h2>
<p>I hardly worked out last year and thanks to my training for marathon, I just didn&rsquo;t have the time or energy to work out at all. When I wasn&rsquo;t training for my marathon, I was just plain lazy.</p>
<h2 id="bouldering">Bouldering</h2>
<p>This fell off also because of my marathon training. I used to be regular and climb twice a week. But it just wasn&rsquo;t feasible.</p>
<h1 id="things-i-explored-aka-side-quests">Things I explored (aka Side Quests)</h1>
<h2 id="snowboarding">Snowboarding</h2>
<p>I picked up snowboarding in early 2019, thanks to my wife. I fell in love with it. I wasn&rsquo;t super interested in winter activities before, but after giving snowboarding a try I was always looking forward to driving to a nearby mountain and keep getting better at snowboarding. I&rsquo;ll be doing more of that this year for sure.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting">Self Hosting</h2>
<p>I stumbled upon self hosting recently and it looked very appealing to me. The fact that I could just use Raspberry Pis to self host few things is what made me more inclined towards trying it out and playing with it. I see privacy concerns with storing my data on Google servers or with any other big corporations. I&rsquo;d rather be in charge of my own data. So, I decided to slowly move things off of cloud services that I&rsquo;m currently using and host my own data. I already set up a private cloud server and it&rsquo;s working like a charm. I got to learn lot of new technologies and it&rsquo;s been fun tinkering with Raspberry Pis.</p>
<h2 id="learning-new-things">Learning new things</h2>
<p>In my journey of learning to self host, I stumbled upon Docker, Traefik, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana and I&rsquo;ve been keen on learning these new technologies. I&rsquo;ve also learnt a lot about networking, DNS, dynamic DNS, VPN, etc. I&rsquo;ve spent many hours playing around with these, failing, learning and redoing a lot of the setup. It&rsquo;s a fun exercise which will continue this year as I get better at hosting a robust system with everything I need.</p>
<h2 id="indie-web">Indie Web</h2>
<p>I stopped using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram few years ago. I knew about what Mastodon was in principle about a year ago, but never really got around to exploring it much. But towards the end of 2019, I checked out few instances in Mastodon and started exploring. I really liked the idea of instances that are built on certain set of principles and people adhering to it, and federating with other instances. I&rsquo;ve only started with Mastodon, but I&rsquo;ll soon be exploring Pixelfed, Pleroma and the likes.</p>
<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h1>
<h2 id="you-cant-do-everything">You can&rsquo;t do <em>everything</em></h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how my brain works. I find something interesting, I want to learn more about it. But I also don&rsquo;t want to give up on all the things I&rsquo;m already doing. I fall short on some of the things (because it&rsquo;s not realistic to master everything, given the limited number of hours in a day). I get disappointed that I&rsquo;m not doing enough. I&rsquo;ve been doing this for years, even though I know that it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. What I should constantly remind myself is that I can&rsquo;t do (or master) <em>everything</em>. I should identify core areas where I want to grow and then focus all my energy on that. I should still explore things, and some of them may grow into something bigger and more important for my personal growth. But I must always acknowledge the fact that there is only limited amount of time and I must use it wisely.</p>
<h2 id="less-consumption-more-creation">Less consumption, more creation</h2>
<p>What I didn&rsquo;t do more of is work on side projects, or create more. Even though, I don&rsquo;t use social media, I still check a lot of blogs and stuff myself with information. It&rsquo;s exhausting. Every time I have couple of minutes free on my hand, I check my phone and try to read a blog post. I have to practice to sit still, not touch my phone and not look at any screen. I used to meditate regularly and it definitely helps with being mindful about what we do. This is something I really want to do this year.</p>
