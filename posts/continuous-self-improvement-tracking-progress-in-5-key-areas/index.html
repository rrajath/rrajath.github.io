				<p>A few years ago, I identified 5 areas in my life that I wanted to keep a close eye on, so that whatever I did was in line with some sort of progress in these 5 spots. They are: <strong>Health</strong>, <strong>Finance</strong>, <strong>Career</strong>, <strong>Relationships</strong> and <strong>Personal Development</strong>. These are the big themes I link all my tasks to. Whenever I think about how my life is going, these are the areas I look at to see which ones need some work and what I can do to make it better.</p>
<p>Everybody’s got different priorities, but over the past years, I settled on these 5 as my main areas that I wanted to concentrate on to live a happy and fulfilling life. How I ended up with these areas is by asking questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What brings me joy and fulfillment and also helps me grow as a person?</li>
<li>What areas should I invest my time and effort in that help me and the people around me live a good life?</li>
<li>What’s something I can do regularly that benefits me both in the short and long term?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-each-of-these-areas-are-important">Why each of these areas are important</h2>
<h3 id="health">Health</h3>
<p>It’s critical to take care of our health because if that’s good then we can focus on other areas of our life. So this includes everything health related, like physical fitness, mental wellbeing, eating right and not drinking too much.</p>
<h3 id="finance">Finance</h3>
<p>It’s not only important to make enough money to live comfortably, but also to be smart with saving and investing. Doing that will yield results (literally) and it’s also good to be informed on how and where to invest to live stress-free.</p>
<h3 id="career">Career</h3>
<p>I love what I do mainly because I work with great people and every day I learn a lot. That makes my workday fulfilling and I’m always looking forward to Mondays.</p>
<h3 id="relationships">Relationships</h3>
<p>Hanging out with people you love makes your life very meaningful. Every activity you do with that person makes the experience that much better.</p>
<h3 id="personal-development">Personal Development</h3>
<p>Always be curious. The moment we link ideas together to form a better understanding of concepts is the best feeling ever. The more we learn the more we link ideas and that way the more we create new ideas.</p>
<h2 id="tracking-progress">Tracking Progress</h2>
<p>Since these are areas, they never end. It’s an ongoing investment of time and effort in each of these areas and there’s no final goal. Everything I do should map to one or more of these areas. They’re a constant reminder to me to keep myself in check and make sure I’m not slipping.</p>
<p>So, when it comes to &ldquo;tracking progress&rdquo;, it’s the smaller tasks (that map to these areas) that I track progress on. But the area itself as a whole, I can look back at a longer time frame, like a couple of years, and see how much I’ve improved in my physical and mental health, my career, my relationships, how I’ve spent the past few years, and how much I’ve learned.</p>
