      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing the &amp;ldquo;Year in Review&amp;rdquo; series for a few years now. At the end of every year, I take some time to think about what went well, what didn’t go well, any side quests I ventured into to get a perspective on how my life is going and what kind of changes it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-went-well&#34;&gt;What went well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read quite a few books in 2022. Some of the notable ones are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels&#34;&gt;Blood, Sweat and Pixels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain&#34;&gt;Building a Second Brain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57423646-immune&#34;&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow&#34;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35957157-thinking-in-bets&#34;&gt;Thinking in Bets&lt;/a&gt;. I read few more books that I didn’t end up finising. However, I did make it a habit to read every single day and right now I’m on a reading streak (30 weeks / 142 days in a row). Kindle’s gamification has certainly helped me read more. I don’t like the idea of setting a reading goal in terms of number of books. I’ve been a victim of trying to finish a dense and dry book and then having the dissatisfaction of not finishing it nag me for weeks. That’s one thing I really want to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-out&#34;&gt;Working out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having couple of incidents of lower back issues and a bunch of physical therapy sessions, I finally decided to join a gym, get personal training and be regular. That’s what happened in Q4 2022 where I started working out regularly and also eating healthier. I see a huge difference health wise and I only wish I started sooner. Nevertheless, this is something I want to keep doing my whole life. Cardiovascular fitness only gets more and more important as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journaling&#34;&gt;Journaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been very regular with journaling and it’s one of the things that’s very underrated, but adds a lot of value. Whenever I’m stressed/overwhelmed, journaling has always been my goto. Doing a weekly, monthly and quarterly review really helped me identify areas for improvement that I would have otherwise missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-week-year&#34;&gt;12-week year&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a book in Jan 2022 called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10009377-the-12-week-year&#34;&gt;The 12 Week Year&lt;/a&gt; and I really liked the idea behind it. It’s basically what the title says. Instead of planning for an entire year, you plan for 12 weeks at a time (plus one week buffer) and then do a review at the end of 12 weeks. The main reason for this is that humans are not great at projecting far into the future. Long term goals get more and more unlikely to get done and it’s easier to project what you can do in the next 12 weeks. This has been a game changer for me and I’m still doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis&#34;&gt;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu9fa4TkWE0&amp;amp;list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&#34;&gt;lecture series on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and it’s absolute gold. Somebody on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions/&#34;&gt;/r/InsightfulQuestions&lt;/a&gt; subreddit mentioned this in one of the comments for a question I don’t even remember and I’m in love with this series. John Vervaeke is so passionate about the topic and is so great at explaining things. There are 50 episodes of about 1 hour each and every single episode is packed with so much information. I couldn’t binge on it because after each episode, I had to take some time to think about what was explained. I really like thinking about philosophical topics and I’m very curious to learn and understand how people in the ancient times thought about things. I highly recommend this series. I’m only on episode 18. I’m planning to complete the series this year. I also take lot of notes for each episode I watch and I publish them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;started-2-other-blogs&#34;&gt;Started 2 other blogs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started 2 blogs. One is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rrajath/knowledge&#34;&gt;Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; which contains book notes or lecture notes (as mentioned above) which is published in a documentation format. The other is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rrajath/CodexVitae&#34;&gt;Codex Vitae&lt;/a&gt; which means Book of Life. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/ideas.md#codex-vitae-aka-book-of-life-or-book-of-beliefs&#34;&gt;got this idea from Buster Benson&lt;/a&gt; and I really liked it. They’re both very rudimentary at the moment. I haven’t thought much about hosting and theming. But I’ll make some improvements and contributions to them. With Codex Vitae, it’s probably going to stay as a GitHub repository since there’s lot of value in tracking version history. Because, especially in this context it shows how my thinking has changed over the course of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-didn-t-go-well&#34;&gt;What didn’t go well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;guitar-practice&#34;&gt;Guitar Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a weird one. I practiced guitar in the beginning of the year and didn’t touch it for months. Then picked it back up at the end of the year. While I’m not happy about the lack of practice for the most part, I’m glad I picked it back up and now I’m seriously trying to practice at least thrice a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the above section, I’ve been on a reading streak for more than half a year and most of that is quite effective. However, I’ve never been super happy with the way I read. I’m the happiest when I read without any distraction for a good chunk of time (at least an hour), make notes, make connections with older notes and form ideas. With a busy lifestyle, I never really got a chance to do all of that. While my reading has been consistent, I do want to take it to the next level and improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;respecting-the-plan&#34;&gt;Respecting the Plan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not very strict with myself about sticking to the plan I make at the beginning of every week. Lot of times, I won’t be able to do things that I planned. Some of them are due to other priorities creeping up and some due to my own laziness. What I didn’t do a good job of was being aggressive about it - by both reflecting on what I didn’t do and could have done, and also tweak the plans as soon as I notice that I won’t be able to achieve them. I basically gotta be more mindful about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;laziness&#34;&gt;Laziness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a root cause than a specific thing that didn’t go well. It was due to laziness that I didn’t practice guitar much, didn’t workout much (initially), didn’t meditate enough and didn’t do 100 other things. Again, being mindful of the failures and really digging deep to figure out why it happened would definitely help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;phone-usage&#34;&gt;Phone Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, my phone usage was quite high. I was averaging at almost 5 hours per day. That’s a lot! Most of this was reading newsletters, blogposts. certain subreddits and also watching TV shows sometimes. I still want to reduce it and keep it under 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;meditation&#34;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very irregular at it. I know the value it provides and I really like meditating, since it gives me immense clarity and helps me calm down. But never made time for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;side-quests&#34;&gt;Side Quests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ergo-mech-keyboards&#34;&gt;Ergo Mech Keyboards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell down the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/&#34;&gt;ergo mech keyboards rabbithole&lt;/a&gt; and quite the rabbithole that was. I was obsessed wih everything about it and ordered a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zsa.io/moonlander&#34;&gt;Moonlander&lt;/a&gt;. I also ordered a bunch of tools to build one myself and ended up building 3 split keyboards. I love using them and each keyboard I built was progressively better than the previous one. I also learned a ton along the way. Not only this, I evangelized it at work so much that I made 4 of my teammates get into building keyboards as well. I consider that more than a win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colemak-dh&#34;&gt;Colemak-DH&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was going down the split keyboard rabbithole, I also saw many posts about how QWERTY is the least efficient keyboard layout, and lot of people suggesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/&#34;&gt;Colemak-DH&lt;/a&gt; to be a better one. I obviously wanted to make that improvement in my life since I use keyboard every single day for several hours and investing some time in learning a new and more efficient layout would pay off in the long run, even though it would slow me down drastically while learning it. I’m glad I made the switch to Colemak. It’s very ergonomic and efficient. This switch happenend sometime in mid-2022. My speed in QWERTY was ~100 wpm and when I switched to Colemak it dropped to 8 wpm. Now I’m getting closer and closer to my QWERTY speeds. Highly recommend Colemak. Also recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.keybr.com/&#34;&gt;keybr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://monkeytype.com/&#34;&gt;MonkeyType&lt;/a&gt; for typing practice. And Tarmak if you want to progressively move away from QWERTY instead of going all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-emacs&#34;&gt;More Emacs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with keyboards, I was also evangelizing about Emacs and got couple of people at work obsessed with it as well. I also kept tinkering the Emacs config and a notable package to callout is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/meow-edit/meow&#34;&gt;Meow&lt;/a&gt;. This made me move away from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil&#34;&gt;evil&lt;/a&gt; and made everything more ergonomic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-stuff&#34;&gt;Learning stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learned quite a few things this year. I dove into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/&#34;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/&#34;&gt;NextJs&lt;/a&gt; and finally CSS. I’ve always been bad at CSS and never had the inclination towards learning it. This time I decided to learn it and it’s still ongoing. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.internetingishard.com/&#34;&gt;Interneting Is Hard&lt;/a&gt; tutorial has been really good and I’ve been learning a lot. Besides that, I also discovered Helix Editor which is blazing fast with a different modal approach compared to vim and I really like it. That’s what prompted me to move away from evil mode in Emacs and switch to Meow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taking-weekly-plan-very-seriously&#34;&gt;Taking weekly plan very seriously&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned in a previous section, I make plans every week but don’t analyze the failures at all. I just push them to next week. Digging deeper will help with many things - getting clarity on why I don’t feel like doing something I had planned, maybe my estimations weren’t right and I took on much more that I could handle, maybe some of the tasks weren’t needed to be done in the first place. Being more mindful while planning, doing the tasks and doing the weekly review will help with both better planning and better execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doing-tasks-mindlessly-is-just-time-wasted&#34;&gt;Doing tasks mindlessly is just time wasted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s difference between &amp;ldquo;meditating&amp;rdquo; (read sitting quietly with eyes closed) for 5 minutes just for the heck of it to check that task off the list and really being fully present. There’s difference between reading things just to keep the streak going vs really diving deep into the subject and understanding the core idea. The former results in a waste of time; time that we’d never get back and time that didn’t yield us anything useful. Even if it’s just doing 2 things in a day, if it’s done mindfully it’ll make the experience so much better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2021 - Year in Review</title>
      <link>/posts/2021-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 11:32:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2021-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this &amp;ldquo;Year in Review&amp;rdquo; for some time now and it helps me put things in perspective as to what I spent more time on, what I enjoyed, where I fell behind, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s a great exercise to do regularly and check in with yourself. So, here are the usual sections - what went well, what didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, side quests and lessons learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-went-well&#34;&gt;What went well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deleted-whatsapp&#34;&gt;Deleted WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was another step in my journey of &amp;ldquo;caring more about privacy&amp;rdquo; and I also &lt;a href=&#34;./posts/whatsapp-privacy-policy-signal&#34;&gt;wrote a blog post about it&lt;/a&gt;. When WhatsApp introduced new terms and conditions to collect even more data than it already did, it motivated people to quit WhatsApp and move to Signal. I did too. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to not be part of all the groups with constant pings and I&amp;rsquo;m even more happy to be part of and in support of a product that actually cares about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;home-automation&#34;&gt;Home Automation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a home in early 2021 and I wanted to change everything to my liking. The rented apartments I lived in wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me change the switches or outlets (obviously) and owning a place gave me the freedom to turn my home into a smarthome. I used HomeAssistant as the hub with a USB stick that supports both ZWave and ZigBee protocols. I changed all the switches to smart switches that operate on ZWave, added a bunch of door sensors, motion sensors, time based automations, etc. Really enjoyed configuring and automating everything I could and I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;journaling&#34;&gt;Journaling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took journaling more seriously in 2021. My initial approach to journaling was about building consistency. And to achieve consistency, I came up with process, structure and templates so that I could make it more &amp;ldquo;streamlined&amp;rdquo;. This led to journaling become a chore instead of an activity that needs to be performed mindfully. So, my journaling habit became more intentional and I was only doing it whenever I really wanted to write something down. This removed the stress of adding an entry every day. What I did force myself to do was to write weekly and monthly reviews which gave me good checkpoints on what went well, what didn&amp;rsquo;t go well and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;built-my-own-emacs-config-from-scratch&#34;&gt;Built my own emacs config from scratch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Emacs for about 1.5 years now and for the first year I used Doom Emacs which gave me pretty much everything I wanted. I hardly added anything extra in my config. But after watching SystemCrafters videos, I decided to roll my own and that was an amazing experience. I learned so much about Emacs in 3 weeks than I did in more than a year. Though laziness is what prevented me initially to create my own config, I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it. I now know exactly what my emacs does and where to look and what to tweak. Since I made this a literate configuration, the whole config is documented and I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded it on GitHub. This also made me create literate config for other applications like zsh, vim, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-didn-t-go-well&#34;&gt;What didn&amp;rsquo;t go well&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;health&#34;&gt;Health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes both diet and fitness. I had pretty bad lower back issues, and I had to stop working out and get some physical therapy. That took a few months after which I started doing yoga which helped me immensely. I knew good posture and exercise were important, but I never realized how important they were until I had these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-notes&#34;&gt;Making Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to make notes a lot when I consumed information via blog posts, podcasts, books or YouTube. I&amp;rsquo;ve been fiddling with Obsidian for a while now, but never got the time to create a workflow to take notes in an effective way. There were technological constraints like the app not being available on the phone initially and then not being easy enough to sync the notes, etc. This is something I want to think more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;side-quests&#34;&gt;Side Quests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;picked-up-guitar--again&#34;&gt;Picked up guitar (again)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing guitar on and off for many years and I&amp;rsquo;ve only played acoustic guitar. I wanted to try an electric guitar and I finally got one. I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying it, especially with the Spark Amp which I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cryptocurrency&#34;&gt;Cryptocurrency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not so much into cryptocurrencies and blockchain, but lately I got interested in them and started exploring the technological side of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been consuming lot of videos and podcasts about cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting journey to say the least. I&amp;rsquo;ve been carving out time here and there to learn about it whenever I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis&#34;&gt;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those serendipitous finds where one day I was checking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reddit.com/r/InsightfulQuestions&#34;&gt;/r/InsightfulQuestions&lt;/a&gt; subreddit where one of the comments for a question (I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember the question) was a mention of a lecture series on YouTube called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_ewcOlY&amp;amp;list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ&#34;&gt;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been really interested in philosophy, anthropology, deep thoughts and thought experiments. So, just watching one episode of this got me hooked. Each episode is dense with information and it also makes you think a lot. I&amp;rsquo;ve been deeply enjoying this series and already made lot of notes and will continue to do so. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been taking it very slow and not binging on it because I want to give myself time to think and reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;never-neglect-health&#34;&gt;Never neglect health&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naval Ravikant said &amp;ldquo;Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life&amp;rdquo;, and it could not be more true. What I thought was maybe a couple of weeks of chilling - being lazy, ordering in, lying on the couch and watching YouTube ended up becoming a lifestyle. Easy choices made me put on weight, be out of shape and be slow and sluggish. Hard choices are to correct these and get back in shape. And this involves cooking at home most of the time, thinking about macros and being more conscious about what I consume, motivating myself to workout and be active. Getting back in shape is not linear. It&amp;rsquo;s harder and takes longer to get back in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;having-few-interests-is-better-than-having-many&#34;&gt;Having few interests is better than having many&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m someone that&amp;rsquo;s very curious about things and I easily get hooked on to learning new things. This isn&amp;rsquo;t sustainable since my interests about stuff keep piling on and it either gets overwhelming or frustrating because I&amp;rsquo;m unable to give my attention to all of them. So, instead of having such varied interests, it&amp;rsquo;s better to have just 2-3 things that you can go deep on and spend more time, and drop the rest. These handful of interests would be more fulfilling than trying to hit too many targets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2020 - Year in Review</title>
      <link>/posts/2020-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 20:30:59 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2020-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 has been quite a year for all of us and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into the long list of things that have shook us this year. We&amp;rsquo;re still resilient and stand strong even though we experience some of the most horrific events we&amp;rsquo;re thrown into. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for being privileged enough in terms of health, career, etc. This year hasn&amp;rsquo;t been the best for pretty much anyone and the same goes for me. Having said that, like I do every year, here are some of the things I did more of, less of, some side quests and lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-i-did-more-of&#34;&gt;Things I did more of&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-hosting&#34;&gt;Self hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started out as a project for a few raspberry pis I had at home where I did a RAID-1 setup initially with NextCloud installed. However, I had to do a lot of heavy lifting in a lot of different areas, like configuring DDNS, setting up another raspberry pi as a mirror for data duplication, and other minor quirks I had along the way. Besides that, there were times when Nextcloud didn&amp;rsquo;t work the way it was supposed to. Like, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t seeing the &amp;lsquo;Sharing&amp;rsquo; tab for any of the files or folders. There was not a lot of help from the community either. Besides that, the raspberry pi I had installed it on was constantly running out of memory. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t devote more time to it and fix all the quirks. Towards the end of 2020, I bought a Synology NAS DS220+ and I&amp;rsquo;ve been very happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DS220+ did all the heavy lifting for me and the initial setup took less than 15 minutes. After that I just had to move my data to it. The DiskStation is definitely a superior and a much nicer product too. The fact that I have a great level of control into how my data is stored, shared and accessed while all the nitty gritty of the configuration is abstracted away has been a great experience. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge time saver and I could focus my time and energy on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chess&#34;&gt;Chess&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarantine prevented me from going out and that made me get into Chess. I spent many hours playing chess with my wife and got better at it. I also solved Chess puzzles on Lichess which I highly recommend if somebody is looking for good chess apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emacsorg-mode&#34;&gt;Emacs/org-mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used org-mode before with Spacemacs and it was okay. The workflow was great when I was in front of my computer, but for &amp;ldquo;on the go&amp;rdquo;, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a good workflow going. This made me disinterested in emacs and org-mode and I switched to a different solution - Notion. I then learned about Doom Emacs which in my opinion is way better than Spacemacs since Spacemacs was really slow and clunky when I used it. With Orgzly installed on my phone, Syncthing set up on my phone and my computer, I got a good system that I could work with. Every day I learn new things about Emacs either intentionally or accidentally and I&amp;rsquo;m loving every bit of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;journaling&#34;&gt;Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I journaled every single day this entire year. There were days when I journaled more and did a lot of brain dumps and there were other days where I journaled very little. I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have developed this habit since it has helped me organize my thoughts, come to logical solutions whenever I&amp;rsquo;m preoccupied with things that bother me, or just write down my thoughts. IMO, it&amp;rsquo;s a very underrated habit and especially over time, you get a good ROI with journaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zettelkasten&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take notes extensively. I used to take notes whenever I read a book, but these days I find myself taking notes when I read blog posts or listen to podcasts too. What I stumbled upon recently was a new note-taking method called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt; (or slip-box) - a system developed by Niklas Luhmann. I write smaller notes where each note contains an idea instead of a book summary. These notes end up getting interconnected to other notes. This system has been working well so far. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where it takes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read few good books this year. I didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on reading more books, but instead focused on reading bits and pieces of different books and reflecting on those ideas. This has been extremely valuable to me compared to how I used to read books or listen to audiobooks. For example, I read a 4 page chapter (called &amp;ldquo;A sketch of good communication&amp;rdquo;) from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lesswrong.com/books&#34;&gt;LessWrong book set&lt;/a&gt; (book name Epistemology) and reflected on it for couple of days which led me to few scenarios where was I guilty of bad communication in the past. The chapter is super interesting and is also available as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yeADMcScw8EW9yxpH/a-sketch-of-good-communication&#34;&gt;blogpost&lt;/a&gt; (as are all other chapters in the book set) if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-i-did-less-of&#34;&gt;Things I did less of&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running&#34;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarantine made us stay home and summer was mostly spent indoors. I did run a couple of times on a treadmill in our apartment gym, but that was closed too after a bit. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to running outside in 2021 once it gets warmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-out&#34;&gt;Working out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped doing bodyweight workouts too and I tend to have mostly focused on eating more, and gaining more weight (though that wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the plan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-projects&#34;&gt;Personal projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the whole WFH situation, I ended up working way more than I did when I used to go to office. This made me so tired that it was extremely hard to get motivated to do personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;side-quests&#34;&gt;Side Quests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-music&#34;&gt;Making music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered Groovepad and I really liked how easy it is to use that app and make music. As of this writing I made 3 tracks and I&amp;rsquo;m planning to put them up on Soundcloud and Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everything that happened in 2020 and so much time being spent indoors, it made me reflect on a lot things. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely grateful to have good health, family, career and friends. It has made me appreciate life more and gave me some perspective. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take things for granted and look the other way. But it takes a lot of strength and speaks to one&amp;rsquo;s character to stand up for the right thing and fight for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2019 in Review</title>
      <link>/posts/2019-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2019-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year done, and like always time flies by quicker and quicker every year. 2019 has been quite eventful in a few aspects and I took some time to reflect on how things went. This time I categorized my activities and personal growth into 3 sections - things I did more of, things I did less of, things I explored. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-i-did-more-of&#34;&gt;Things I did more of&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running&#34;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was faster (compared to last year) in almost all my races in 2019. I also participated in more races and set a few PRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stats&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in for Autism 10K - 53m 33s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day Half - 1h 57m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Run 5K (trail run) - 29m 1s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergreen Half - 1h 53m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craft Classic Half - 1h 49m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron Horse Half - 1h 42m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly 5K - 25m 46s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snohomish 10K - 51m 51s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snohomish River Run Full - 3h 56m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off with the 10K in April with no training and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to see that my time only improved from then on. There was a time when I was running half marathons every couple of weeks and it got a little exhausting. But it feels great to look back and see all the races I&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;marathon&#34;&gt;Marathon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full marathon gets a special mention because the training was fun and the race, even more so. In 2018, I did my first full marathon and the training was quite brutal - mostly because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to expect. And, I got first hand experience of what mile 18 feels like in a full marathon. But in 2019, I knew how the training would be, I knew how to prep and how to recover, when to push myself and when to take it easy. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/intermediate-1-marathon&#34;&gt;Hal Higdon&amp;rsquo;s Intermediate 1 training plan&lt;/a&gt; and made my own modifications to it. Overall, I improved and set a PR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traveling&#34;&gt;Traveling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some traveling in 2019 with a few road trips - one in Oregon, couple in Washington, and few hikes around Seattle. I also visited Los Angeles. The most amazing and memorable one was the 4-day Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu which was a birthday gift from my wife. Highly recommend going there and doing the 4-day hike, it&amp;rsquo;s totally worth it. Also, a shout out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alpacaexpeditions.com&#34;&gt;Alpaca Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; for their awesome crew that helped us with the hike, food, camps, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-i-did-less-of&#34;&gt;Things I did less of&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading&#34;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell off on the reading habit and ended up reading only about 14 books (compared to 24 in 2018). This is something I want to get back into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-out&#34;&gt;Working out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hardly worked out last year and thanks to my training for marathon, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time or energy to work out at all. When I wasn&amp;rsquo;t training for my marathon, I was just plain lazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bouldering&#34;&gt;Bouldering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fell off also because of my marathon training. I used to be regular and climb twice a week. But it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;things-i-explored-aka-side-quests&#34;&gt;Things I explored (aka Side Quests)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;snowboarding&#34;&gt;Snowboarding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up snowboarding in early 2019, thanks to my wife. I fell in love with it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t super interested in winter activities before, but after giving snowboarding a try I was always looking forward to driving to a nearby mountain and keep getting better at snowboarding. I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing more of that this year for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-hosting&#34;&gt;Self Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon self hosting recently and it looked very appealing to me. The fact that I could just use Raspberry Pis to self host few things is what made me more inclined towards trying it out and playing with it. I see privacy concerns with storing my data on Google servers or with any other big corporations. I&amp;rsquo;d rather be in charge of my own data. So, I decided to slowly move things off of cloud services that I&amp;rsquo;m currently using and host my own data. I already set up a private cloud server and it&amp;rsquo;s working like a charm. I got to learn lot of new technologies and it&amp;rsquo;s been fun tinkering with Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-new-things&#34;&gt;Learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my journey of learning to self host, I stumbled upon Docker, Traefik, Ansible, Prometheus, Grafana and I&amp;rsquo;ve been keen on learning these new technologies. I&amp;rsquo;ve also learnt a lot about networking, DNS, dynamic DNS, VPN, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many hours playing around with these, failing, learning and redoing a lot of the setup. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun exercise which will continue this year as I get better at hosting a robust system with everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;indie-web&#34;&gt;Indie Web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram few years ago. I knew about what Mastodon was in principle about a year ago, but never really got around to exploring it much. But towards the end of 2019, I checked out few instances in Mastodon and started exploring. I really liked the idea of instances that are built on certain set of principles and people adhering to it, and federating with other instances. I&amp;rsquo;ve only started with Mastodon, but I&amp;rsquo;ll soon be exploring Pixelfed, Pleroma and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-cant-do-everything&#34;&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t do &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how my brain works. I find something interesting, I want to learn more about it. But I also don&amp;rsquo;t want to give up on all the things I&amp;rsquo;m already doing. I fall short on some of the things (because it&amp;rsquo;s not realistic to master everything, given the limited number of hours in a day). I get disappointed that I&amp;rsquo;m not doing enough. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this for years, even though I know that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. What I should constantly remind myself is that I can&amp;rsquo;t do (or master) &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;. I should identify core areas where I want to grow and then focus all my energy on that. I should still explore things, and some of them may grow into something bigger and more important for my personal growth. But I must always acknowledge the fact that there is only limited amount of time and I must use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;less-consumption-more-creation&#34;&gt;Less consumption, more creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t do more of is work on side projects, or create more. Even though, I don&amp;rsquo;t use social media, I still check a lot of blogs and stuff myself with information. It&amp;rsquo;s exhausting. Every time I have couple of minutes free on my hand, I check my phone and try to read a blog post. I have to practice to sit still, not touch my phone and not look at any screen. I used to meditate regularly and it definitely helps with being mindful about what we do. This is something I really want to do this year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2018 in Review</title>
      <link>/posts/2018-year-in-review/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/posts/2018-year-in-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2018 went by really quick. It was one of the more eventful years - packed with activities, travel, new hobbies, experiences and accomplishments. I have been following James Clear and Tim Ferris for a long time now and &lt;a href=&#34;https://jamesclear.com/2018-annual-review&#34;&gt;their posts&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&#34;https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/&#34;&gt;past year review&lt;/a&gt; have been the inspiration behind this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t like setting goals, but rather invest my time in building habits, as I feel they&amp;rsquo;re more sustainable and long term rather than having an end point that brings me a lot of anxiety while approaching the due date. I like small incremental progress on a daily basis than few days of powering through a task that ends up half-baked. Having said that, I do like to identify few areas I want to focus on to at least head in a general direction to form a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the goals (or habits) I had planned for 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice guitar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update blog more regularly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat fruits every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice mindfulness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-went-well&#34;&gt;What went well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to maintain a list called 2018 Highlights. I did this to keep track of the main events that happened to me in 2018, as a look back to see how it went. This list contained things that I tried for the first time, or something outside the ordinary, memorable activities and accomplishments. Here are some of more noteworthy ones from my list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finished Level 1 of Japanese on Memrise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picked up Origami&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picked up Chess (and solving Chess puzzles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picked up Rubiks cube and got pretty good at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Started meditating every day (325 days and counting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted my Facebook account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 hikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 half marathons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 10Ks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 full marathon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides this list, here&amp;rsquo;s a little more on how I did with my goals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;read-more-books&#34;&gt;Read more books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read 27 books in 2017 and I wanted to read more than that in 2018. Due to other commitments, I didn&amp;rsquo;t hit that mark. I did have phases where I&amp;rsquo;d read books every day and there were weeks where I didn&amp;rsquo;t read them. But I got to read lot of good books on various topics like Physics, Philosophy, Biology, Biographies, and Running.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9699298-rajath-ramakrishna?read_at=2018&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of books I read in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learn-yoga&#34;&gt;Learn yoga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started doing yoga at the rock climbing gym that I was going to. I started with Yin Yoga and fell in love with it. I did it very regularly for few months. I had to stop when I was training for my marathon, since there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough time to fit climbing, yoga, strength training and 5 days of running in my 7 day schedule. However, I&amp;rsquo;m back to yoga and climbing after taking a 3-month break. Trying Vinyasa now just to see how it is. This is a habit that I plan to continue as I&amp;rsquo;m already seeing the benefits it has on my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;eat-fruits-every-day&#34;&gt;Eat fruits every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was decided on a whim when I realized I wasn&amp;rsquo;t eating a lot of fruits. I wanted to have a healthy diet, but always missed out on fruits due to laziness. I succeeded in this by incorporating fruits at different parts of my diet, most of them being part of my breakfast smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-mindfulness&#34;&gt;Practice Mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime in March, I was reading some blog and I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.headspace.com/&#34;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;. I had heard of it before, but I never bothered trying it because I was not very interested in guided meditations. This time I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll bite the bullet and give it a shot, and bought a yearly subscription. It was one of the best decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve made recently as it helped me meditate better and be more mindful. My run streak in the app says 325 days and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it either as soon as I wake up, or during my commute or sometimes before I go to sleep or whenever I have some time during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running&#34;&gt;Running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was probably the best year for running. The year started off with my getting back to running after my knee injury (and couple of months of physical therapy). Starting off with 10 minute runs on the treadmill, I ended up doing my first half marathon in March. And it only got better after that. Here&amp;rsquo;s all the runs I did in 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: Mercer Island Half Marathon (1h 53m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: 10K Autism Run (53m 28s)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day Half Marathon (1h 59m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: Seattle Rock N&amp;rsquo; Roll Half Marathon (1h 48m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: 10K Trail Run (55m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: Snohomish River Run Full Marathon (4h 16m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to run more this year. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;daily-journaling&#34;&gt;Daily Journaling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I was never interested in until last year. But I thought of giving it a shot. I did it for an entire year and I don&amp;rsquo;t regret it, I still do it. I realized the importance of putting my thoughts down. It helped me think more clearly and the habit of doing it every day makes me reflect on my days from a different perspective. I use the app &lt;a href=&#34;https://daylio.webflow.io/&#34;&gt;Daylio&lt;/a&gt; which captures the activity and mood as well, and it gives a nice graph every week to see how the past week went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-didnt-go-well&#34;&gt;What didn&amp;rsquo;t go well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I enjoyed reading books, doing yoga and running a lot, there were goals that I missed. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-guitar&#34;&gt;Practice Guitar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make this a regular habit, but never got around to it. There were phases - couple of weeks of every day practice and then couple of months of nothing, mainly due to work commitments. Things just got hectic and I stopped playing guitar. This is something I want to work on. To keep the practice consistent, even if I&amp;rsquo;m playing for few minutes every other day. It&amp;rsquo;s a good stress-buster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blog-regularly&#34;&gt;Blog Regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the worst of all. Never made a single blog post in the entire year, even though I had it as a goal. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly due to the problem of inertia. It&amp;rsquo;s so hard for me to get started on simple tasks, or tasks that only take few minutes. But once I start, I&amp;rsquo;ll have enough momentum to finish it off. Hope I blog more often this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;side-quests&#34;&gt;Side Quests&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the goals I had, there were few things I picked up during the year. Mainly because I somehow got interested in them long enough to actually commit a good chunk of time learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rubiks Cube&lt;/strong&gt;: My best time to solving a 3x3x3 is about 2m 15s now. Planning on improving it :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kendama&lt;/strong&gt;: My friend got Kendama at work and I was fascinated by it. I bought one for myself and ended up learning few tricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Origami&lt;/strong&gt;: Made some cool stuff like DNA, Hyperbolic Paraboloid, Tangram, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1 of Japanese on Memrise&lt;/strong&gt;: Decided to learn a new language - Japanese. Finished Level 1 on Memrise. Will pick it up later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side projects with Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong&gt;: Set up &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt; (a network-wide ad-blocking software). Also tried setting up a voice assistant using &lt;a href=&#34;http://snips.ai&#34;&gt;snips.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the speaker to work, but everything else worked fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picked up drawing&lt;/strong&gt;: This was a one-off thing where I saw a Medium post about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/personal-growth/a-quick-beginners-guide-to-drawing-58213877715e&#34;&gt;Quick Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Drawing&lt;/a&gt; that involved hand workouts for pencil sketching and I just did those. Things like, filling up a page with circles and another one with hatched lines. Turned out pretty good, but never continued it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-i-learned&#34;&gt;What I learned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the things I did and didn&amp;rsquo;t do, here are the lessons I learned in 2018:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;youre-never-ready-just-go-for-it&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re never ready, just go for it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this from my running. Beginning of the year, I never thought of doing a half marathon (which I did in March), let alone doing a full marathon. After my friend forced me to sign up, I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll do it even if I sucked at it. And it went pretty well, for my first time - did it in under 2 hours. Same with running a full marathon in October. I thought I&amp;rsquo;m not ready for a full. But I also thought I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t regret later. And it was pretty good time (4h 16m) for a first timer :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-underestimate-the-training&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate the training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one again comes from running. I finished my first full marathon in just over 4 hours, but looking back I see hundreds of hours of running, hundreds of miles of running, lot of IT band issues, hurt ankles, hurt everything. There were many times I lost hope during training, especially when I hurt my IT band during the run and then end up limping for the next two days. But it&amp;rsquo;s that rigorous training that helped me do well in the actual event. What I got out of it is that if you&amp;rsquo;re going for something big, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to train a lot, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to put in the hours. Not every day will turn out the way you want. There will be good days. There will be bad days. And there will definitely be shitty days. You just got to persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;try-to-increase-your-circle-of-competence&#34;&gt;Try to increase your circle of competence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence&#34;&gt;Circle of Competence Theory&lt;/a&gt; developed by Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger is something I believe in and strive to live every day. The more you learn and expand your knowledge, the more you realize you don&amp;rsquo;t know enough. Try to learn new things outside your domain. This will help you think with new perspectives and also help find unique solutions to problems you face in your every day life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wraps up 2018. It definitely was an eventful year and I learnt a lot. Looking forward to another year of activities, travel, new hobbies, more running, and hopefully more accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2015 - Lessons Learned</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a couple of posts about what people did in 2015 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@vanschneider/my-2015-the-year-of-change-e90c71a50a1e#.lxzac07mb&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.fogus.me/2015/12/29/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2015/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) that inspired me to write my own. While both posts go in good detail about what they accomplished, my post kind of does the opposite. Mine is more about me reflecting on what I had planned to do, what I did and what I didn&amp;rsquo;t do, and lessons learned during that. And
new year is a good time to look back on how the past one year went; how productive/lazy you were, how committed/easy going you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, I wrote down some goals for myself. I called it goals instead of resolutions (like I used to before) to make it sound serious (after all the goal-setting we do at our workplace). And to be honest it worked, to an extent. Couple of goals, I really crushed it and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about it, but few others, meh. Most importantly when I look at the whole of 2015 I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to see how I functioned. I was keeping myself busy for the most part doing something and learning
something, but now I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to show for all that. So I want to write down the lessons I learned for each goal that I had set and think about how I can improve what I&amp;rsquo;m doing well and also work on my shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what went well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workout (a.k.a Project Lose-The-Tummy)&lt;/strong&gt;: I&amp;rsquo;m lazy. Physical activities wise, fitness wise, I&amp;rsquo;m really lazy. I go on few hikes in the summer, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. I just stay indoors rest of the time glued to my laptop. I&amp;rsquo;ve been this way for few years now and I&amp;rsquo;ve acquired enough fat around my waist. For the first 5 months after setting this goal, I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything. One day when I looked at myself in the mirror, I said &amp;ldquo;Shit! I should do something about it&amp;rdquo;. And I started running one
mile, thrice a week. After that I slowly started running more and more. Then I started going to the gym in my apartment 5 days a week. Been doing it for close to 6 months now. I won&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m in perfect shape. But I can see the difference. Also from the time I started going to the gym, my eating habits have improved. So that&amp;rsquo;s a happy byproduct of a good habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more books (Goodreads reading challenge)&lt;/strong&gt;: I never used to read books, and I know that&amp;rsquo;s a bad thing. One must read as many books as possible. The knowledge we get from them is immense. Also, I wanted to have hobbies that don&amp;rsquo;t involve a screen. So I picked up a Kindle Paperwhite, but that screen doesn&amp;rsquo;t count :) Goodreads has this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/3890-2016-reading-challenge&#34;&gt;reading challenge&lt;/a&gt; that you can take up and track your progress. You can also see
what your friends have set their reading challenges as and what they&amp;rsquo;re reading to get some nice recommendations. Anyway, I took the Goodreads reading challenge and set a goal for myself to read 10 books this year. I read 12, which is good. I plan to read more in 2016. I&amp;rsquo;ll take up that challenge again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the books I read:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s it for what went well. Here&amp;rsquo;s stuff that didn&amp;rsquo;t go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make an Android app every 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;: There&amp;rsquo;s so much going on in Android app development that it&amp;rsquo;s quite hard to catch up. My goal was to learn different design patterns, libraries, architectures and get to a comfortable state where I could develop apps with ease. Why I said 3 months is because I felt that would be enough time for me to learn some patterns/architectures, spend time in design and make a stable app while managing hectic work schedules and on call, instead of something that was hacked over a weekend just to make
things work. I also wanted to learn a bit of UI design to not only make the apps scalable, maintainable and robust, but also beautiful. I tried making 3 Android phone apps and 1 Android wear app and I took 2 of them close to completion, but never completed. Where I went wrong is I spent too much time in design and wanted to get everything perfect the first time. Also, when I was halfway through the development I would come across blog posts about the right way of designing your app, or
the best suited pattern and I would get lost in reading more about these patterns. After reading them I&amp;rsquo;d be in a dilemma if I should continue what I was doing that or redo the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I learnt from all this. If you&amp;rsquo;re making an app as a side project, go ahead with it and finish it. Completion is more important than quality, at least for beginners. Moreover, you can call the shitty version as v1. Then you can add all sorts of improvements later on and make it nice, but at the end of the day every bit of it would be a good learning experience. It may not be the best app, but you get to learn so much about how not to do stuff. Also, if you complete the
app you&amp;rsquo;ll have some level of satisfaction as compared to how you feel when you just stop working on your side project for a while and it dies out. Things you do well and don&amp;rsquo;t do well both make for a good blog post. So, that&amp;rsquo;s a good way to keep your blog updated too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play Guitar&lt;/strong&gt;: I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to quantify this goal or measure it, so I made it a little vague. This is less of a goal and more like a hobby. This is the second hobby that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve a screen. I started playing the guitar regularly on weekends for the first 2-3 months and then I just got busy with work and on call. An hour or two per week shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard enough to allocate and practice. I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on this in 2016 and come up with a more solid plan to follow a course, read up some
theory, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog every week&lt;/strong&gt;: I did terribly on this. I made two blog posts in 2015 and that&amp;rsquo;s it. It should have been a weekly thing where I talk about what I did the previous week or some random stuff I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. But for some reason, I was way too lazy to update my blog. Even though I was sometimes working on my side project and learning new things. I should just keep it more updated in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of my goals and how I did against them taught me more about myself and how I handle things. To me, at least now, it boils down to these 3 things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;. If there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that&amp;rsquo;s present in the goals that went well and absent in the ones that didn&amp;rsquo;t go well, it&amp;rsquo;s discipline. Because discipline trumps motivation. Motivation is temporary; it&amp;rsquo;s like a spark, it comes and goes. You can&amp;rsquo;t keep waiting to get motivated in order to start working on something. Discipline on the other hand is more permanent. It&amp;rsquo;s something that you religiously follow, something you&amp;rsquo;re accountable to. If I have a discipline that I must blog every
week, come what may, then I will make most of my week eventful to make that happen. This helps in both blog-writing and also working on my side projects. I&amp;rsquo;d get better at both coding and writing. :) Same goes with side projects. Some days you&amp;rsquo;re exhausted after work and you don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to work on your side project. That&amp;rsquo;s a good time to refactor your code or read some blogs about best practices, new libraries/frameworks, whatever. In order to become an expert at something, you
need to work on it every day and keep practicing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. You cannot become an expert over night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish what you start&lt;/strong&gt;. Always finish what you start. A goal left midway is more disappointing than not doing it at all because you start feeling that you had the capability to finish it had you put in a little more effort, but you just didn&amp;rsquo;t do it. It may turn out to be a shitty app, or a shitty blog post. Only if you finish what you start, you&amp;rsquo;ll know where you went wrong and what can be improved. Nobody gets it right the first time and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to get it right the first time. Learning is important. Learning is
beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review your goals often&lt;/strong&gt;. Never be lazy. Do something. Anything. Anything productive. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to chill out sometimes, but otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep learning and making the best use of your time. Reviewing your goals on a timely basis helps you to stay on track and get shit done. Sometimes you may end up in a state where you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re doing something pretty much every day, but not really getting anywhere. By making your goals measurable and reviewing them regularly, you
know exactly how far away you are from your goal and you can work towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
